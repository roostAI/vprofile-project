Scenario 1: Verify getElasticsearchHost method when Elasticsearch host is set

Details:
  TestName: getElasticsearchHostWhenSetValue
  Description: This test is meant to check the getElasticsearchHost method of the Components class when the Elasticsearch host has been previously set. Specifically, it will test if the correct value is returned.
Execution:
  Arrange: A Components entity is created and the setElasticsearchHost method is called to set a known value.
  Act: The getElasticsearchHost method is called on the Components entity.
  Assert: JUnit assertion is used to compare the actual result from the getElasticsearchHost method against the expected value (the value set by the setElasticsearchHost method).
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getElasticsearchHost method correctly retrieves the value that was set using the setElasticsearchHost method. This test is significant in the context of application behavior as it confirms the expected behavior of the getter method.

Scenario 2: Verify getElasticsearchHost method when Elasticsearch host is not set

Details:
  TestName: getElasticsearchHostWhenNotSetValue
  Description: This test is meant to check the getElasticsearchHost method of the Components class when the Elasticsearch host has not been previously set. Specifically, it should return null or a default value.
Execution:
  Arrange: A Components entity is created.
  Act: The getElasticsearchHost method is called on the Components entity.
  Assert: JUnit assertion is used to compare the actual result from the getElasticsearchHost method against the expected value which in this case is null or a default value.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getElasticsearchHost method returns null or a default value when the Elasticsearch host is not set. This test helps validate the behavior of the getter method when dealing with uninitialized variables.
