"Scenario 1: getId - Happy Path
  Details:
    TestName: testValidIdRetrieval
    Description: This test is designed to validate the retrieval of a valid User ID from the entity instance.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate a User object and set a known ID using setId(Long id).
    Act: Retrieve the ID of the user instance using the getId() method.
    Assert: Compare the retrieved ID against the expected ID value using an appropriate JUnit assertion, such as assertEquals().
  Validation:
    This test is checking the fundamental ability of the User entity to correctly store and retrieve a set user ID. If this basic retrieval functionality does not work as expected, it could indicate a serious problem in the User entity's Id handling that could impact other application functionality.

Scenario 2: getId - Null Id
  Details:
    TestName: testNullIdRetrieval
    Description: This test is designed to handle a situation where a User instance has no Id assigned to it.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate a User object without setting an ID.
    Act: Retrieve the ID of the user instance using the getId() method.
    Assert: Use a JUnit assertion to ensure that the returned ID is null.
  Validation:
    This test validates the getId() method's handling when no ID has been set. Null handling is crucial for avoiding unexpected Null Pointer Exceptions during application runtime.

Scenario 3: getId - Very Long Id
  Details:
    TestName: testVeryLongIdRetrieval
    Description: This test is designed to handle the case where the set User ID is very large.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate a User object and set a very large ID using setId(Long id).
    Act: Retrieve the ID of the user instance using the getId() method.
    Assert: Compare the retrieved ID against the expected large ID value using an appropriate JUnit assertion, such as assertEquals().
  Validation:
    This test is checking the ability of the User entity to correctly store and retrieve a very large ID. This scenario is important to ensure the User entity can handle any permissible size for Id input.

Please note that the details of these scenarios may change based on the constraints and validation rules of your domain objects such as the User. Also, ensure to use try-catch where exceptions are expected.
