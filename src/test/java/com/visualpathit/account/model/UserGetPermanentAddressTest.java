Here's a list of possible JUnit test scenarios for the method `getPermanentAddress` in the `User` class. These scenarios are structured to cover various possible cases, including normal, boundary, and error conditions.
```plaintext
Scenario 1: Retrieve Permanent Address of a User with Valid Address
Details:
  TestName: retrievePermanentAddressWithValidData
  Description: This test verifies that the `getPermanentAddress` method returns the correct permanent address that was previously set for a user. It ensures the basic functionality of retrieving a normal valid permanent address.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new `User` object and set a valid string address using the `setPermanentAddress` method.
  Act: Invoke the `getPermanentAddress` method to retrieve the address.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to ensure that the returned address matches the valid address that was initially set.
Validation:
  This assertion checks the core functionality of address retrieval, ensuring the basic operation of the getter method corresponds with the setter's input.
Scenario 2: Retrieve Permanent Address of a User with Empty Address
Details:
  TestName: retrievePermanentAddressWhenAddressIsEmpty
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the `getPermanentAddress` method when the permanent address is set to an empty string. It ensures that the method handles empty strings appropriately.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new `User` object and set an empty string as the permanent address using the `setPermanentAddress` method.
  Act: Call the `getPermanentAddress` method to get the address.
  Assert: Verify that the returned address is an empty string, as set previously.
Validation:
  The test aims to confirm that the method can handle an edge case where the address is technically present but contains no characters.
Scenario 3: Retrieve Permanent Address of a User with Null Address
Details:
  TestName: retrievePermanentAddressWhenAddressIsNull
  Description: This test evaluates the behavior of the `getPermanentAddress` when no address is set, meaning it remains as default (null). It checks if the method correctly returns null in this scenario.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new `User` object without initializing the permanent address.
  Act: Execute the `getPermanentAddress` method to obtain the address value.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is null, indicating no address was set.
Validation:
  This test verifies robustness against uninitialized states, ensuring the method gracefully handles scenarios where no address is available.
Scenario 4: Retrieve Permanent Address of a User with Special Characters
Details:
  TestName: retrievePermanentAddressWithSpecialCharacters
  Description: This test scenario tests the `getPermanentAddress` method when the permanent address contains special characters. It ensures that special characters are preserved and handled correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new `User` object and set an address containing special characters (e.g., "#1234, Apt @ Blvd!") using `setPermanentAddress`.
  Act: Invoke `getPermanentAddress` to fetch the previously set address.
  Assert: Validate that the output matches exactly with the input string containing special characters.
Validation:
  Special characters are common in addresses and should be properly supported by the implementation, reflecting accurate data handling.
Scenario 5: Retrieve Permanent Address After Address Update
Details:
  TestName: retrievePermanentAddressAfterUpdate
  Description: This test assesses the `getPermanentAddress` method's behavior after updating the address. It checks for consistency before and after a change in address.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a `User` object, set an initial permanent address using `setPermanentAddress`, update it with a new address.
  Act: Call `getPermanentAddress` to obtain the updated address.
  Assert: Confirm if the retrieved address matches the most recently updated address.
Validation:
  The test is significant for verifying address update functionality and ensuring data consistency across changes.
```
These scenarios aim to cover a range of possible use cases for the `getPermanentAddress` method, including normal operations, edge cases, and error conditions. Each scenario has a clear structure for arrangement, action, assertion, and validation.
