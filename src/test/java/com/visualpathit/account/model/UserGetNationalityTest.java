"""
Scenario 1: Test to check the response when the nationality of the user is set

Details:
  TestName: testGetNationalityWhenNationalityIsSet.
  Description: This test will check the functioning of the getNationality() method. It is designed to validate the scenario when the nationality of a user object has been set.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create a user object and set the nationality.
  Act: Call the getNationality() method on the user object.
  Assert: Check whether the method correctly returns the nationality that was set.

Validation:
  This assertion is verifying that the getNationality() method is functioning as expected. If the nationality is correctly returned, it means the nationality field is correctly stored and retrieved, which is vital for keeping track of user information in the application.

Scenario 2: Test to check the response when the nationality of a user is not set

Details:
  TestName: testGetNationalityWhenNationalityIsNotSet.
  Description: This test will check the functioning of the getNationality() method. It is designed to validate the scenario when the nationality of a user object has not been set.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create a user object without setting the nationality.
  Act: Call the getNationality() method on the user object.
  Assert: Check whether the method correctly returns null or an expected default value.

Validation:
  This assertion is checking the robustness of the getNationality() method. It should be able to handle the case where nationality is not set, either by returning null or a default value, without causing an error. This is essential to ensure that the application does not crash when it encounters user objects with missing fields.

Scenario 3: Test to check user object immutability

Details:
  TestName: testGetNationalityDoesNotExposeInternalState.
  Description: This test will ensure the getNationality() is not exposing the internal state of user object and compromising immutability.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create a user object and set the nationality.
  Act: Call the getNationality() method and attempt to change the returned value.
  Assert: Check whether the nationality stored in the user object remains untouched.

Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the getNationality() method is not compromising user object's immutability. In a properly functioning application, it should not be possible to modify the state of an object through getter methods. This helps in keeping the state of objects consistent and protects against inadvertent changes.
