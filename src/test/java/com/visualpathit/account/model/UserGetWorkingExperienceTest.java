Test Scenarios:

Scenario 1: Test to Ensure the getWorkingExperience() Returns the Correctly set Working Experience

Details:
TestName: testGetWorkingExperienceReturnValue
Description: This test is intended to check that the getter method getWorkingExperience() retrieves the correct working experience that has been previously set.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a User object and set its working experience using the setWorkingExperience(String workingExperience) method.
    Act: Call the getWorkingExperience() method on the created User object.
    Assert: Compare the returned working experience against the one that was initially set.
Validation:
    This test verifies that the getWorkingExperience() method retrieves the correct workingExperience that was set in the User object. The significance is to ensure that correct working experience information is made available when the getter method is called.

Scenario 2: Test for Calling getWorkingExperience() method without setting the Working Experience first

Details:
TestName: testGetWorkingExperienceWithoutSetting
Description: This test will validate that calling getWorkingExperience() method on a newly created User object without setting the working experience first, returns null or an empty string.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a User object without setting any working experience.
    Act: Call the getWorkingExperience() method in the object.
    Assert: Verify that the returned result is null or an empty string.
Validation:
    This test verifies that the getter method getWorkingExperience() returns null or an empty string when called on a new User object without the working experience being set first. This is important for handling cases where a User object is created with incomplete information.

Scenario 3: Test for Calling getWorkingExperience() method after changing the Working Experience

Details:
TestName: testGetWorkingExperienceAfterChanging
Description: This test verifies that the getWorkingExperience() method retrieves the updated working experience when the value is changed.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a User object and set a working experience. Then, change it by calling the setWorkingExperience(String workingExperience) method with a new value.
    Act: Call the getWorkingExperience() method in the object.
    Assert: Check that the returned working experience matches the new value.
Validation:
    This test ensures that the getWorkingExperience() method correctly tracks changes in the working experience. This is essential for ensuring accurate data retrieval.


Note: All these scenarios assume that workingExperience is a String field in the User class, and it's public. If that is not the case, these scenarios may need modifications accordingly. Considering the document does not provide the actual User class' structure therefore, assumptions made based on the common practices of the POJO classes.
