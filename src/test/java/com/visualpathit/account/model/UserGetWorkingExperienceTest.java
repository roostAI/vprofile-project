```
Scenario 1: Validate Default Working Experience Value

Details:
  TestName: validateDefaultWorkingExperienceValue
  Description: This test checks the default value of the working experience attribute when a new User object is instantiated, without any specific value set. The expectation is that there is either a default value or the field remains null.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the User class.
  Act: Retrieve the working experience value using the getWorkingExperience method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the retrieved value is null or matches a known default if there's any predefined default value.

Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the working experience field is either uninitialized (null) or holds a default value. This is significant to ensure proper initialization, preventing null pointer exceptions or unexpected behavior.

Scenario 2: Set and Retrieve Working Experience Value

Details:
  TestName: setAndRetrieveWorkingExperienceValue
  Description: This test checks whether the setWorkingExperience method effectively stores a given valid string, and whether getWorkingExperience returns exactly what was set.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the User class and define a valid working experience string.
  Act: Invoke setWorkingExperience with the defined string and subsequently call getWorkingExperience.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned value from getWorkingExperience against the original valid string.

Validation:
  The assertion verifies the integrity of the set and get operations for working experience, ensuring that data accuracy is maintained within the User object.

Scenario 3: Working Experience with Special Characters

Details:
  TestName: workingExperienceWithSpecialCharacters
  Description: This test validates whether User's setWorkingExperience and getWorkingExperience methods can handle strings with special characters without any issues.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the User class and define a working experience string that includes special characters.
  Act: Set the special-character string using setWorkingExperience and subsequently retrieve it using getWorkingExperience.
  Assert: Verify that the retrieved working experience is identical to the given input string.

Validation:
  This test ensures that special characters are handled correctly, verifying that no data is lost or altered when stored or retrieved, supporting a wider range of input formats.

Scenario 4: Working Experience with Long String

Details:
  TestName: workingExperienceWithLongString
  Description: This test examines how the User class handles scenarios where an excessively long string is set as working experience.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the User class and define an extremely long working experience string.
  Act: Set this long string using setWorkingExperience, then retrieve it with getWorkingExperience.
  Assert: Confirm that the returned output matches the long input string exactly.

Validation:
  By verifying long strings, this test checks for potential size limitations or performance issues, ensuring robust handling of large inputs without truncation or errors.

Scenario 5: Null Working Experience Value

Details:
  TestName: nullWorkingExperienceValue
  Description: This test evaluates the behavior of the User class when a null value is explicitly set for working experience.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the User class.
  Act: Assign null to the working experience using setWorkingExperience, and retrieve it using getWorkingExperience.
  Assert: Ensure that the getWorkingExperience method returns null.

Validation:
  This test is crucial for understanding how null values are treated, ensuring that the application can handle null gracefully without causing unexpected behavior or errors.

Scenario 6: Working Experience Reset Test

Details:
  TestName: workingExperienceResetTest
  Description: This test checks the ability to change the working experience after it has already been set to a non-null value.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the User class, set an initial working experience string, then change it to a new string.
  Act: Set the first string using setWorkingExperience, change it by invoking setWorkingExperience with a new string, and retrieve the value using getWorkingExperience.
  Assert: Verify that the method returns the new string, confirming that the value has been successfully updated.

Validation:
  The test demonstrates the mutability of the field, confirming that changes can be made post-initialization, supporting dynamic updates and ensuring flexibility in handling user data.
