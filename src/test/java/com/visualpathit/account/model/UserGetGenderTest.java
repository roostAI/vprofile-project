Scenario 1: Test to verify the User's gender
Details:
    TestName: testGetGenderWhenUserIsMale.
    Description: This test is planned to verify that the getGender() method is returning the correct value when the User's gender was set as "Male".
Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate a User object and set the gender value as "Male".
    Act: Call the getGender() method on the User object.
    Assert: Use a JUnit assertion to verify that the returned gender is "Male".
Validation:
    The assertion is checking whether the gender of the created User object is actually "Male". A successful test here confirms that the getGender() method is working as expected for the given scenario.

Scenario 2: Test to verify User's gender when not set
Details:
    TestName: testGetGenderWhenGenderNotSet.
    Description: This test is to check that the getGender() method returns null or empty when no gender has been set for User.
Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate a User object without setting a value for the gender.
    Act: Invoke the getGender() method on the User object.
    Assert: Use a JUnit assertion to confirm that the returned value is either null or an empty string.
Validation:
    The purpose of this assertion is to verify that the getGender() method correctly handles the case where no gender has been specified. A successful test would indicate that the method effectively handles such cases, aligned with the business rule that a user's gender is optional.

Scenario 3: Test to verify User's gender for non-binary values
Details:
    TestName: testGetGenderWhenUserIsNonBinary.
    Description: This test is set to verify that the getGender() method is returning the correct value when the User's gender is set as "Non-binary", which is a valid gender value in some systems.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a User object and set the gender value as "Non-binary".
    Act: Call the getGender() method on the User object.
    Assert: Use a JUnit assertion to check that the returned gender is "Non-binary".
Validation:
    The assertion is checking whether the gender of the newly created User object is indeed "Non-binary". A successful test would validate that the getGender() method is functioning properly and supports non-binary gender options, complying with the inclusivity requirements of the system.

Scenario 4: Test to validate User's gender for other valid String inputs
Details:
    TestName: testGetGenderForOtherValidValues.
    Description: This test is meant to check the getGender() method's functionality when User's gender is another valid String value (like "Transgender", "Other", "Not to say").
Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate a User object and set the gender as another valid String value.
    Act: Invoke the getGender() method on the User object.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertion to validate that the returned gender is the same as what was set initially.
Validation:
    This assertion is to check whether the User entity handles the gender fieldName which could have various valid String values. If the test passes, it implies the correctness and reliability of the getGender() method to handle such values as per the application's business rules.
