"Scenario 1: Validate retrieval of User's Email
Details:
    TestName: testGetUserEmail.
    Description: This test validates the ability of the 'getUserEmail' method to correctly retrieve the user's email.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create or provide a User object and set an initial email through the 'setUserEmail' method.
    Act: Invoke the 'getUserEmail' method on the User object.
    Assert: Check that the returned email matches the one set initially on the User object.
Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the 'getUserEmail' method can correctly retrieve the email set on a user. The expected result is that the returned email should be identical to the email set on the User entity. This is a fundamental aspect of object state retrieval and is crucial for accurate user information management.

Scenario 2: Handle NULL User Email
Details:
    TestName: testNullUserEmail.
    Description: This test validates how the 'getUserEmail' method handles a User where the email was never explicitly set (should be NULL by default).
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a User object without setting the email.
    Act: Invoke the 'getUserEmail' method on the User object.
    Assert: Check that the returned email is NULL.
Validation:
    The test aims to confirm that 'getUserEmail' correctly returns NULL in cases where the User's email was not set. This behavior is expected as primitive types like 'userEmail' (String) are expected to be NULL if not explicitly set.

Scenario 3: Handle Empty User Email
Details:
    TestName: testEmptyUserEmail.
    Description: This test validates how the 'getUserEmail' method handles a User where the email was set to an empty string "".
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a User object and set the email as an empty string.
    Act: Invoke the 'getUserEmail' method on the User object.
    Assert: Check that the returned email is an empty string "".
Validation:
    This test aims to confirm that 'getUserEmail' correctly returns an empty string when the User's email was explicitly set as such. This validation is necessary to ensure the method can correctly handle and return states where the User has no email provided.
