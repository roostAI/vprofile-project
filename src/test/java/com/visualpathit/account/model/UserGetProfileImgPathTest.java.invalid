Scenario 1: Valid Profile Image Path Test

Details:  
  TestName: validateProfileImgPath.
  Description: This test aims to check if the getProfileImgPath() method returns a valid profile image path when it's set using the setProfileImgPath method. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new User object and set a valid image path via setProfileImgPath.
  Act: Call the getProfileImgPath() method on the created user object.
  Assert: Compare the returned profile image path with the path we set initially.
Validation: 
  This assertion checks whether the set profile image path is correctly retrieved by the getProfileImgPath method. It is significant in the context of ensuring profile image path integrity and attribute encapsulation within the User entity. 

Scenario 2: Profile Image Path is Null Test

Details:  
  TestName: testNullProfileImgPath.
  Description: The test checks if the getProfileImgPath method returns null when the profile image path is not set. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new User object without setting a profile image path.
  Act: Call the getProfileImgPath method on the user object.
  Assert: Assert that the returned profile image path is null.
Validation: 
  This test assures that when the profile image path isn't provided, it should return null. It validates attribute encapsulation within the User entity and assures the structural integrity of the User class.

Scenario 3: Empty Profile Image Path Test

Details:  
  TestName: testEmptyProfileImgPath.
  Description: The test checks if the getProfileImgPath method returns an empty string when the profile image path is set to an empty string. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new User object and set an empty string as the profile image path.
  Act: Call the getProfileImgPath method on the user object.
  Assert: Assert that the returned profile image path is an empty string.
Validation: 
  This test checks whether an empty profile image path can be assigned and retrieved from the User object. This scenario demonstrates the need to check for empty strings in the application's validation routines or attribute setters.
