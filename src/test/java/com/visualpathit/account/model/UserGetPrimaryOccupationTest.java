Scenario 1: Test to ensure the User's primary occupation is returned accurately.

Details:
  TestName: testGetPrimaryOccupation.
  Description: This test is meant to check the successful retrieval of User's primary occupation. The User's primary occupation is assumed to be properly set up in the database.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of User and set the primary occupation value.
  Act: Invoke getPrimaryOccupation() on this User instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned string matches the value set as the User's primary occupation.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly returns the User's primary occupation. This is an expected result because in a correct system setup, the User's primary occupation should be accurately retrieved.

Scenario 2: Test to check if null is returned when User's primary occupation is not set.

Details:
  TestName: testNoPrimaryOccupation.
  Description: This test checks the scenario where the User's primary occupation is not set up in the database. The method is expected to return null in this case.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of User but do not set a primary occupation.
  Act: Invoke getPrimaryOccupation() on this User instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned string is null.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly handles a situation where the User's primary occupation has not been set up. This is an expected result because without setting primary occupation, the system should return null.

Scenario 3: Test to check handling of unusual or long string values as primary occupation.

Details:
  TestName: testLongStringPrimaryOccupation.
  Description: This test is to check if the User's primary occupation which is a prolonged or unusual string, can be handled by the method.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of User and set the primary occupation to a very long or unusual string.
  Act: Invoke getPrimaryOccupation() on this User instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned string matches the value set as the User's primary occupation.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly handles and returns the User's primary occupation regardless of its length or unusual characters. This is important for ensuring the robustness and the flexibility of the system.

Scenario 4: Test for empty string value as primary occupation.

Details:
  TestName: testEmptyStringPrimaryOccupation.
  Description: This test checks whether getPrimaryOccupation() can handle the scenario when user's primary occupation is an empty string.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of User and set the primary occupation as an empty string.
  Act: Invoke getPrimaryOccupation() on this User instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned string is empty.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly returns an empty string as the User's primary occupation when User's primary occupation is set to an empty string. This ensures that the method does not fail or return unintended results in the presence of empty string inputs.
