ROOST_METHOD_HASH=getPrimaryOccupation_9fdf89cb59
ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=getPrimaryOccupation_27b64db649

Scenario 1: Validate that the correct Primary Occupation is returned by the User

Details:
  TestName: getPrimaryOccupationReturnsCorrectValue.
  Description: This test is meant to confirm that the User's `getPrimaryOccupation` method correctly returns the user's actual primary occupation as previously set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new User and use the `setPrimaryOccupation` method to assign a primary occupation to the User.
  Act: Invoke the `getPrimaryOccupation` method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the return value of `getPrimaryOccupation` with the expected value.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the value returned by `getPrimaryOccupation` matches with the value set through `setPrimaryOccupation`. This test checks the proper functioning of the getter method for the primary occupation field in isolation, ensuring it is not impacted by other fields or methods.

Scenario 2: Validate that `getPrimaryOccupation` returns null when no primary occupation is set to the User

Details:
  TestName: getPrimaryOccupationReturnsNullIfNotSet.
  Description: This test is meant to confirm that the `getPrimaryOccupation` method returns null when no primary occupation was previously set to the User.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new User without setting a primary occupation.
  Act: Invoke the `getPrimaryOccupation` method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the return value of `getPrimaryOccupation` with null.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that `getPrimaryOccupation` correctly recognizes when the user's primary occupation is not set and accurately return null. This test is important to ensure the method can gracefully handle and communicate about the absence of a primary occupation.

Scenario 3: Validate that changing the Primary Occupation in a User after it was set previously gives the correct value

Details:
  TestName: getPrimaryOccupationReflectsChangesCorrectly.
  Description: This test is meant to confirm that the `getPrimaryOccupation` method reflects changes made to the primary occupation after it was initially set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new User, set a primary occupation. Then change that primary occupation value by calling the `setPrimaryOccupation` method again with a different value.
  Act: Invoke the `getPrimaryOccupation` method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the return value of `getPrimaryOccupation` with the new value.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that `getPrimaryOccupation` correctly responds to updates in the user's primary occupation. This test ensures that the getter method accurately reflects changes made to the primary occupation field.
