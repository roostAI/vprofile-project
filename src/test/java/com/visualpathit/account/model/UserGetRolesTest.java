"Scenario 1: Validating Successful Retrieval of User Role

Details:
  TestName: testGetUserRolesSuccessCase
  Description: The test aims to verify that the getRoles method returns the correct set of user roles. The user is expected to have a set of roles assigned and the method should return them successfully.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a User instance and set a non-empty set of roles.
  Act: Call the getRoles method on the User instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned set of roles matches the previously set user roles.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the getRoles method returns the expected set of roles. This is critical as roles regulate user rights and permissions within the application.

Scenario 2: Check Edge Case where No Roles have been assigned to User

Details:
  TestName: testGetUserRolesWithNoRolesAssigned
  Description: The test checks the functionality of the getRoles method when no roles are assigned to the user. The method should return an empty set in this case.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a User instance without setting any roles.
  Act: Execute the getRoles method on the User instance.
  Assert: Assert that an empty set is returned.
Validation:
  The assertion checks whether the getRoles method correctly handles a situation where no roles are assigned to the user. This is necessary to ensure that the method can handle edge cases and behaves as expected.

Scenario 3: Check the method behavior with Null Roles

Details:
  TestName: testGetUserRolesWhenRolesAreNull
  Description: The aim of this test is to check how the getRoles method behaves when the roles of the user are set to null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a User instance and explicitly set the roles to null.
  Act: Call the getRoles method on the User instance.
  Assert: Assert that a NullPointerException is thrown.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to confirm that the getRoles method throws an exception when the roles are null. This will ensure that the method handles null values appropriately and prevents null-pointer exceptions.

NOTE: This scenario is based on the assumption that your code is following a convention that returning null is not a valid way to indicate no roles. If your application handles null roles differently, you might need to adjust this scenario

Please adjust the assumptions and the expected outcomes according to your application requirements.
