ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=getFatherName_842160bcd6

Scenario 1: Verify the returned father's name when a valid father's name has been set
Details:
  TestName: testReturnValidFatherName
  Description: This test is meant to verify the correct functionality of getFatherName() method by asserting that it returns the correct father's name that has been set by the setFatherName() method.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a User instance and set a valid father's name using the setFatherName() method.
  Act: Invoke the getFatherName() method on the User instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to ensure the returned father's name matches the one that was set.
Validation:
  This assertion aims to verify that the getFatherName() method correctly retrieves the father's name that was set. This is a basic test to ensure the getter method functions properly.

Scenario 2: Verify the returned father's name when no father's name has been set
Details:
  TestName: testReturnNullWhenNoFatherNameSet
  Description: This test checks whether the getFatherName() method returns null when no father's name has been set using the setFatherName() method.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a User instance without setting a father's name.
  Act: Invoke the getFatherName() method on the User instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to ensure the returned father's name is null.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the getFatherName() method returns null when no father's name has been set. This test demonstrates that the method should handle missing data gracefully and return null in such situations.

Scenario 3: Verify the returned father's name when a father's name with special characters has been set
Details:
  TestName: testReturnFatherNameWithSpecialCharacters
  Description: This test is designed to check the getFatherName() method's handling of special characters by asserting that it correctly returns a father’s name that includes special characters.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a User instance and set a father’s name with special characters using the setFatherName() method.
  Act: Invoke the getFatherName() method on the User instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to ensure the returned father's name matches the one with special characters that was set.
Validation:
  This assertion is aimed at verifying that the getFatherName() method handles special characters correctly. This test case is significant for ensuring the system handles a variety of string inputs accurately.
